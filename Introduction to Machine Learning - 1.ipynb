    "Machine Learning (ML) is a subfield of AI that involves the development of algorithms that can automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms can be classified into three types: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning involves training an algorithm on a labeled dataset, while unsupervised learning involves finding patterns in an unlabeled dataset. Reinforcement learning involves training an agent to take actions in an environment to maximize a reward signal. "
