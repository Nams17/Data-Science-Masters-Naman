    "### R-squared, also known as the coefficient of determination, is a statistical measure used to evaluate the goodness of fit of a linear regression model. It indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variables in the model. In other words, R-squared quantifies how well the linear regression model captures the variability in the data.\n",
    "### R-squared is calculated as the ratio of the explained sum of squares (ESS) to the total sum of squares (TSS). It ranges from 0 to 1, with a higher value indicating a better fit of the model to the data.\n",
    "### Mathematically, R-squared is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared = 1 - (RSS / TSS)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpreting R-squared:\n",
    "- R-squared of 1: It indicates that the linear regression model explains all the variability in the dependent variable. In this case, all data points fall perfectly on the regression line.\n",
    "- R-squared close to 1: It indicates that the model captures a large proportion of the variability in the dependent variable. The predictions by the model align closely with the actual values.\n",
    "- R-squared close to 0: It indicates that the model does not explain much of the variability in the dependent variable. The predictions by the model do not align well with the actual values.\n",
    "- R-squared negative: It indicates that the model performs worse than simply using the mean value of the dependent variable as the prediction. The model is not capturing any meaningful relationship."

    "### Advantages of RMSE, MSE, and MAE as evaluation metrics in regression analysis:\n",
    "- Easy interpretation: RMSE, MSE, and MAE are straightforward metrics that provide a clear measure of the prediction accuracy in the same units as the dependent variable. This makes it easy to interpret and compare the performance of different models.\n",
    "- Sensitivity to outliers: RMSE, MSE, and MAE give equal weight to all errors, including outliers. This can be advantageous when outliers have a significant impact on the overall model performance and need to be appropriately penalized.\n",
    "- Robustness to non-normality: RMSE, MSE, and MAE do not rely on the assumption of normality in the errors. They are robust metrics that can be used in situations where the error distribution deviates from normality.\n",
    "### Disadvantages of RMSE, MSE, and MAE as evaluation metrics in regression analysis:\n",
    "- Lack of context: RMSE, MSE, and MAE do not provide information about the practical significance of the prediction errors. They do not indicate whether the errors are large or small in relation to the problem's context or whether they have any real-world implications.\n",
    "- Focus on overall error: RMSE, MSE, and MAE consider the overall error across all observations but do not provide insights into the pattern of errors. They do not capture potential heteroscedasticity or systematic biases in the model.\n",
    "- Sensitivity to scale: RMSE and MSE are sensitive to the scale of the dependent variable since they involve squaring the errors. This means that models with larger values in the dependent variable may have higher RMSE or MSE compared to models with smaller values, even if their prediction accuracy is similar."

    "### Lasso regularization, also known as L1 regularization, is a technique used in regression analysis to introduce a penalty on the absolute value of the coefficients. It adds a term to the objective function of the regression model, which consists of the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients multiplied by a regularization parameter (lambda) that controls the strength of the penalty.\n",
    "### Lasso regularization differs from Ridge regularization (L2 regularization) in the type of penalty applied to the coefficients. While Lasso regularization penalizes the absolute values of the coefficients, Ridge regularization penalizes the squared values of the coefficients.\n",
    "### Lasso regularization is more appropriate to use when there is a need for feature selection or when the data contains a large number of features, some of which may be irrelevant or redundant. By setting some coefficients to zero, Lasso can simplify the model and improve interpretability by focusing on the most relevant features. It is particularly useful when dealing with high-dimensional datasets, where there are more features than observations.\n",
    "### However, if all the features in the dataset are considered important and there is no need for explicit feature selection, Ridge regularization may be more appropriate. Ridge regularization can be beneficial when dealing with multicollinearity among the features, as it can help reduce the impact of collinear variables by shrinking their coefficients."

However, in real-world scenarios, the relationship may be non-linear. Using a linear model in such cases may result in underfitting and poor predictive performance.\n",
