    "MongoDB is a popular NoSQL document-oriented database management system that stores data in flexible and dynamic JSON-like documents called BSON. It provides a scalable and high-performance database solution that can handle large and complex datasets with ease.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are databases that do not use the traditional relational model with tables, columns, and rows. Instead, they use a variety of different data models such as document-based, key-value, graph, or column-family. They are often used for storing and processing large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data that cannot be easily modeled in a traditional relational database.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where:\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexible and dynamic data models are required - MongoDB's document-based model allows for flexible and dynamic schemas that can handle changing data requirements.\n",

    "Large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data need to be stored and processed - MongoDB's ability to store and query complex and nested data structures makes it a good fit for big data applications.\n",
