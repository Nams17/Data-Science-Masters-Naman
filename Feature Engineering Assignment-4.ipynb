    "### Data encoding refers to the process of converting categorical or qualitative data into a numerical representation that can be understood and processed by machine learning algorithms. It is a crucial step in data science as many machine learning algorithms require numerical inputs to perform their computations effectively.\n",
    "### Data encoding is useful in data science for the following reasons:\n",
    "### Numerical representation: Most machine learning algorithms operate on numerical data. By encoding categorical variables into numerical values, we enable the algorithms to process and analyze the data effectively.\n",
    "### Feature representation: Encoding helps to represent categorical features in a meaningful way that captures their inherent information. This allows the machine learning models to learn patterns and relationships within the data accurately."

In nominal encoding, each category is represented by a binary feature (or column) where a value of 1 indicates the presence of that category and 0 indicates its absence.\n",

Each column indicates whether a particular category is present or not for that customer. For example, in the first row, the customer has DSL as their internet service, so the value in the \"Internet Service_DSL\" column is 1, and the values in the other two columns are 0."
